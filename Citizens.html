      <p>The hardest hit in this conflict have been the average citizens who want nothing more than to live in peace. What
      started as a protest to increase thier rights has become a more and more extreme conflict with the citizens increasingly marginalized.
      Cities like Raqqa have been taken over by extremist groups imposing harsh sharia law on the populace, while other cities like Aleppo or Homs
      have been reduced to rubble by regime bombs and rebel fighters. There is no police force, ambulance brigades, or basic infrastructure in many of these
      areas. The regime cuts power and displaces populaces in order to harm the rebels. leading to sites that look like this:</p>
      <p>The city of Aleppo has been hit particularly hard. Since it is the capital of the nation both the rebels and the 
      regime fight fiercely to control it. Vicious house to house fighting has erupted and the regime, in order to gain 
      the upper hand, has been bombing the city. A city with a former population of 2 million has been reduced to a 
      population of under a million. Infrastruture is gone and those who stayed behind fight for their survival. 
      VICE news has a profound report on the city and its struggling inhabitants as they try to rebuild what they have 
      and survive in an active warzone. Like many other VICE reports this video is GRAPHIC. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg5UEz_Ao0g"> Click here to view</a>
      The Red cross has attempted to help the people of syria and many other humanitarian missions have been launched. However without the full 
      cooperation of niehgboring naitons like Turkey it seems the syrian people may be condemned to a hell on earth. Visit the red cross website
